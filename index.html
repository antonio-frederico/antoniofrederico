              <p>The first installation I made worked as an inquiry into questions of authorship, virtuality and embedded meaning (or the opposite of these things). This minimal intervention derives from signs found in the landscape. The work consists of 28 cryptic patterns painted on chosen trees. No two signs are the same and they all obey simple rules for their composition, which have been abstracted from the geometry of readymade trail markings. Instead of guiding people through a continuous line, these traces face the observer and indiscreetly point to the surrounding landscape. Thus, the work dislocates both the sense of direction and the expectation of meaning of whoever finds it.</p>

              <p><h3>IV (What)</h3></p>
              <p>Around Topolo, on the trails that cut through the forest, one can find markings that indicate the path. For them to establish visibility, contrast is achieved by the use of two different colors painted at eye height on trees and rocks. These noticeable strokes prevent hikers from getting lost. </p>		
              <p>In scrutinizing their shape, one can recognize that the existing simplicity relates both to their function and origin: these signs should be distinguishable from the surroundings and convenient to fabricate.</p>
              <p>The geometric solution consists of a rectangle that has, as height, twice the size of the brush used to paint it, and, as length, double the size of the first measure. The end result usually approximates the proportion of 1x2. This systematic approach provides for an angular rigor rarely produced by non-human action so the condition of sign is immediately recognizable.</p>
              <p>The encounter between isotropic geometry and an irregular, decaying world provides for a myriad of effects that obey different time scales: A tree might crack the paint, whereas a rock might let it be peeled away by weathering. This dynamic is not welcome in an unfamiliar context. The fading away of the color is a troublesome condition for visitors because it means the loss of efficacy for the purpose of path signaling.</p>

              <br>
              <p><h3>III (How)</h3></p>
              <p>With the same abstract rules, one can study the possible variations that geometry concedes for dividing a rectangle into two parts with the use of a single line (which starts and ends either at the edge’s midpoint or at one of the corners).</p>
              <p>The existence of such variations in the context of trail marking is unlikely, because, although these alternatives have an analogous syntax, they disobey the pragmatic principle of convenient technical reproduction. Hence, these constitute an implausible possible.</p>
              <p>The intervention consisted of painting, within a clear predetermined area, 28 trees and rocks with these cryptic anagrams. Whereas normal signs might indicate something, these equivocal marks dislocate the sense of direction. Because they are randomly situated in the landscape, these insignificant signs cannot point at anything in particular. They simply embody the condition of purposeless possibilities.</p>

          <p>My contribution to the 9th issue of Robida Magazine was based on the execution and archival of an ephemeral installation. Within the time frame of daylight, I clandestinely swapped the land belonging to two bordering countries. In place of what was previously national soil, now there lies ground coming from the opposite side of the border. Be that as it may, the completion of the work made the intervention barely traceable. The only register of this event are some images caught by camera, together with a dirt diagram and a couple of sonnets written in the aftermath.</p>

          <p>The exchange was realized on an undisclosed site in the forest, in the authoritative limbo that characterizes the limit between two sovereign states. As a symbolic gesture executed over an immaterial historical division, the precise location of this work is ultimately abstract: it might have happened anywhere along an imaginary line, or an invisible threshold which can be traced thanks to concrete monoliths that were placed in this land when the border between Italy and Yugoslavia was drawn in the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>

          <p>Subterranean Transactions was inspired by neoconcrete “Poema Enterrado” (1959)  - or “Buried Poem” - by Ferreira Gullar, as alluded to in the ending verse of one of the sonnets published on the Suolo / Prtst / Soil issue of Robida Magazine.</p>

          <p>After over a year of work in Northern Portugal (in the territory around Arcos de Valdevez) with FAHR 021.3, Hugo and I published a text with some reflections regarding our methodology of involving art practices directly into urban/landscape planning starting from the project phase. The article critically overviews this experience based on the work of the first artist in residency, the photographer Joan Alvado.</p>
          <p>This article presents the partial results of an ongoing territorial practice/research project in the north of Portugal. The approach adopted is unprecedented in that cultural programming artistic practices are called upon at the design phase in order to provide input for territorial planning. Based on the need to get to know a territory as a result of an intervention requirement, a model of artist residencies is used as a tool to know a particular place. In this process, the work of the invited artist is conducted with the aim of revealing certain dimensions of everyday life. This approach, however, encounters methodological, institutional and artistic challenges. By reflecting on the first case-study of this experimental model (the photographic project carried out by Joan Alvado), we aim to open up a space for the discussion and perpetuation of similar strategies for integrating art and the built landscape.</p>
          <p>The article is divided into five parts. Starting with the contemporary context from which discursive concerns about the incorporation of cultural alterities into creative processes arise, it moves on to a brief contextualization and critique of artistic approaches with an anthropological bias. Next, the landscape relating to the context of the work in question is presented and the case study carried out in Arcos de Valdevez is described. Finally, we conclude by raising some weaknesses and opportunities for future applications of this integration.</p>

          <p>The day after I moved to Topolò, the first episode of “When Thinking is Doing: a radio show for handy theory” was broadcast at Radio Robida. This project was originally supposed to focus on craft and its peripheral manifestations, but it quickly became more encompassing in scope as it started to deal with different perspectives regarding aesthetics, philosophy of technology and new materialism(s).</p>

          <p>Things disclose worlds. Subjacent to any symbolic sphere, the ways we approach our earthly dealings are mediated by hard artifacts. What can we learn through their making? In When Thinking is Doing, we aim not so much to think about craft, but rather by means of it.</p>

          <h2>Season 2 / 2024</h2>
          <p>The world is a whole. From a materialist perspective, between dense solids and rarefied plasmas, the discontinuities of tangible matter are always a question of scale and never actual interruptions on the fabric of reality. And yet, not only do we perceive, but we also enforce borders.</p>
          <p>A border separates. It stipulates a distinction between elements. It creates opposites out of what is. What are the consequences of this segmenting action for the ways in which we conceptualize the world? Is there something advantageous to approach intellectual impasses by establishing simple antinomies among things? Could it be dangerous to polarize? How and why?</p>
          <p>In the second season of When Thinking is Doing, we will indulge in bordering thought. In each episode, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia conceptualizes craft and its neighboring areas by creating clear categories around them - often, only to find out that these limits are porous and trespassers negotiate their confines just as we are not looking. Through the perspectives of different guests engaged with hand and head work, we will try to better understand not only the complexities of making, but of the making of the world.</p>

          <p>Craft as a category of practice historically emerged from the contrast between artisanal modes of production and modern industry. How can we deterritorialize craft and its congenital opposition to mechanized labour? In the eight episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by guests Antonio Sotzu and Jean Ni in order to discuss stratified ideas about relations of labour. In our conversation, matters of pleasure, knowledge and meaning in old-fashioned techniques are discussed with regard to their territorial approach to stone artifact making/maintenance. We also discuss their life-project Foghiles, based in Semèstene, Sardinia, where borders between life and art are dissolved.</p>

          <p>The term craft is usually reserved to qualify a way of making material things. How would this notion stand when transposed to the immaterial realm? In the ninth episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by Kirsten Spruit and Benjamin Earl in order to think through the border between the digital and the analog. As we look for procedures analogous to craft within digital tools, we consider themes like the poetic web, handmade websites, Ben and Kirsten’s “code of conduct of code”, as well as their growing interest in rituals of maintenance.</p>

          <p>The ways of aesthetically engaging with matter have been deployed with varying importance according to each particular culture. Could it be that the different social standings that different art practices historically reached in the West is related to a phenomenology of sensory experience? In the tenth episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by Suzanne Bernhardt and Phillip Kolman in order to think about the making of food. While we go outside to forage while-cherry blossoms Phillip and Suzanne speak about how they see their cooking practice with regard to autochthonous food cultures, the role of the ephemerality in taste and the ecological consequences of alimentary production.</p>

          <p>Between matter’s character and maker’s character, what might craft mean when one attends to the way in which raw materials express their forms? In the eleventh episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by the architect and cabinetmaker Diogo Amaro in order to think about the border between form and matter. The conversation touches on themes like anticipation and spontaneity in work, the role of prototyping, the contrast between serial and singular production and the consequences of an empirical approach to design.</p>

          <p>Art matters. Or, at least, art is made out of matter. Or is it? In the twelfth episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by Ola Korbańska in order to think about the border between material and immaterial. As we follow the sewing of an iteration of “THE FLAG OF 3,” our conversation touches on themes like: the materiality of words and the longest way of writing things, the incorporation of gender struggles into artistic discourse; the adoption of constraints as a creative methodology; the phased development of technique over time; the joy of making things; and the purposeful contamination of artworks by their contextual conditions of production.</p>

          <p>When Jan van der Pleog was in Topolò last August, I followed him through the restoration of two wall paintings he made a few years ago. As one of the murals metamorphosed into the third version of itself, while the other kept its former colors and composition, it left me wondering about the who and the how of art. // In the thirteenth episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia speaks to Jan van der Pleog about his work as a painter. The conversation touches on themes like Jan’s relation to the village of Topolò through the years thanks to Stazione Topolò / Postaja Topolove, his early experiences in the shift of mediums from oil painting to mural painting and his phased approach towards his practice, based on the isolated stages of composition and execution.</p>

          <p>The immobility of stone makes it a suitable medium for enforcing sculpture’s traditional role as a spatial disciplinary dispositive, as, in the words of Rosalind Krauss, “it sits in a particular place and speaks in a symbolical tongue about the meaning or use of that place.” But what if the materiality of marble was used otherwise, as an artifice to question sedimented conventions about public space? // In the fourteenth episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by Hugo Reis in order to think about the act of demarcating borders. As we follow his artistic/research practice by transporting boulders around the city of Évora, we discuss the relation between art and urbanism and reflect about sculpture in the expanded field.</p>

          <p>How do objects choreograph the gestures around them? In the sixteenth episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by Gustavo Ciríaco, together with Filipa Frois Almeida and Hugo Reis from FAHR 021.3, in order to reflect on plan and play. This conversation was carried out after the development of the artistic residency “Cérebro/Brains,” which resulted in an intervention that draws from the spatial poetics of Portuguese sculptor Miguel Palma. As we discuss the methodology adopted by Círiaco in the series “Covered by Sky,” we reflect on how art may incorporate different forms of alterity by way of relationality: either through the dialogue with other authors’ discourse, through public engagement or through the activation of the landscape.</p>

Our conversation was held after Luigi mas in Topolò in the winter of 2024 for the Sensing Soils residency. As we discuss the work he developed around foraged local clay, we think through notions like purity and impurity, the value of labour and materials, and the empirical transmission of knowledge across space and time.</p>

          <p>How does graphic design relate to the sense of time passing and time arrested? Between absence and presence, permanence and decay, how can art help us remain alert to what is already there? In the 18th episode of When Thinking is Doing, recorded during the Sensing Soils residency in Topolò, Antonio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by Heike Reneé de Wit in order to speak about the border between – between forest and village, solitude and collectivity, visibility and invisibility. Through different ways of approaching the landscape, Heike explores gestures that generate spatial experiences that are ephemeral, playful, and deeply embodied. What emerges is a form of silent language, coded through anatomy, scale, and ground, that reflects on the afterlife of materials and the (super)natural composition of forms.</p>

          <p>How does one’s engagement to material processes shape the way the world is perceived? Can gestures repeated across time and space carry meaning beyond their original function? And what is the role of design and designer when one chooses to follow the intelligence of materials? In the nineteenth episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antonio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by Miao Li in order to think about ways of attending to matter. As we accompany Miao’s workshop practice, our conversation touches on experiences with fiber art and ceramics that employ both traditional and experimental techniques. Guided by animist philosophies and Buddhist meditation, Miao’s understanding of beauty offers a quiet, but radical reimagining of contemporary aesthetics, rooted in attention and intuition for the slow unfolding of form.</p>

And what kind of artistic roles emerge from the tension between natural spontaneity and artificial order – especially after the experiences of romanticism, conceptualism, land art, and the ecological turn in artistic discourse? In the 20th episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by Milah van Zuilen in order to discuss her practice between forest ecology and art. Our conversation touches on the materiality of contemporary and primordial forms, the intersection between the methodologies of art and science, the use of the grid to make sense of nature, the role of artistic residencies in promoting social relations and her experience as a host in Jaro, in the Czech Republic.</p>

          <p>What is the difference between knowing something in theory and knowing it with your own body? And why does our culture still tend to value one more than the other? In this episode, we follow a story that brings to light the kinds of understanding that cannot be easily abstracted or codified: ways of knowing that are directly derived from practice. What if these forms of knowledge are precisely what we need in order to navigate the intertwined crises of food, health and ecology today? For the 21st episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia visits Bakkerij Mater, a sourdough bakery in Amsterdam run by the van Aalst family: Sascha, Philip, Nick, and Willem. What began as an improvised experiment with homemade bread slowly became a space for communal gathering, embodied politics and ecological transition. As we talk about natural fermentation, networks of production, croissants and the daily rhythms of dough, we also uncover personal stories of departure and arrival. With different backgrounds ranging from corporate finance to yoga teaching and academic philosophy, they now work together in a place where knowing how is not less than knowing that.</p>

          <p>When people refer to technology in a colloquial sense, they usually mean high-tech stuff like automobiles, skyscrapers or telecommunication systems, which depend on the integration of many different parts. The lure of technological complexity makes it easy to overlook the embedded cleverness of low-tech artifacts, which couple material simplicity with technical effectiveness. From times immemorial, craft cultures from all around the globe found many fine solutions for locally sourced materials. These were informed by the constituent capacities of working matters (such as the friction of fibers, the resistance of stone, the pliability of clay and so on).</p>
          <div class="image-container"><img src="project6_images/CANAVIAL_ANTONIO FREDERICO LASALVIA_AAA013.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo by Thomas Symosz"><span class="alt-text"></span></div>
          <p>In 2022 I found myself among another dozen young designers under the scorching sun of Évora’s summer in order to make sense of the overlap between these two worlds (if one insists on making such a rigid distinction): high-tech and low-tech. The premise of the workshop was “artisanship meets digital fabrication,” and we were engaged in designing and building a shading device made from locally harvested cane.</p>
          <p>After some speculative prototyping, we finally arrived at the conclusion that the best way to structure this material had already been invented long before we put our minds to it. It was actually all around us, we just had to have eyes to see it. It is hard to tell precisely where woven cane fences were first made, but nowadays this art can easily be spotted in any warm-weather country, usually employed by small production farmers to enclose their crops and land.</p>
          <p>Cane weaving is a dirt-cheap technique, but working this material is not an easy job. The fibers of this bamboo-like plant are unforgiving (because they easily break when twisted in the wrong direction) and are quite hard on the laboring hands (since the splitting of cane creates very fine splinters). Moreover, the result of this craft is not particularly durable when in direct contact with ground moisture, a condition which is usually addressed in the case of farmers not by avoiding it, but by simply weaving a new fence every few years. I guess all of these things created some cultural stigma around this material and made it a no-go for both designers and architects.</p>
          <div class="image-container"><img src="project6_images/CANAVIAL_ANTONIO FREDERICO LASALVIA_Canavial.gif" alt="Video by Fatima Durkee ⒸPassaAoFuturo"><span class="alt-text"></span></div>
          <p>Back to our workshop, and to our attempt to reclaim cane as building matter, it was only once we realized that we did not have to invent anything new that the whole process of making finally flowed smoothly. In order to address the moisture problem, we designed the structure in such a way that it could be easily disassembled during the rainy season. And, as a way to achieve enough height in order to create shadow with this weaving technique (cane fences are usually no higher than a meter or so), we simply inverted the orientation of the weave in relation to the ground. By aligning the longer cane pieces perpendicularly to the floor, we mimicked the normal solicitations of this material and took advantage of its natural resistance to the efforts generated by wind and gravity.</p>
          <p>The result worked wonders. Although the structure was located on an unshaded field, the temperature inside was several degrees cooler than the outside. Moreover, the openness between the weaved panels allowed the interior of the structure to be penetrated by a very welcome summer breeze.</p>
          <p>As an allusion to the fact that we - almost - managed to build the whole thing with just one material (some wicker and cotton fibers were also used in order to tie the poles and the panels), we decided to embrace the organic character of this grown material and leave the cane tops untrimmed.</p>

          <p>Marc-Antonie Laugier fantasized about archaic man and double shed roofs when he described the seminal origins of architecture with the so-called “primitive hut”. Richard Serra, a few centuries later, arrived at a steeper conclusion which was formally not too distant from Laugier’s abstraction, despite this sculptor's perpetual rebellion against architecture. Amid these two unrelated episodes, the average expression between the sister disciplines of three dimensional space may lie not in two, nor in four, but in three intersecting planes.</p>

          <p>During my Master’s degree in Universidade do Porto, I partook in a course on structural conception and experimentation. The semester’s exercise started with a constraint, something that I always consider a welcome element in creative contexts. We had at our disposal the volume of one cubic meter of concrete and were allowed to shape it as we pleased as long as the result expressed the potential of this material to behave as structure. </p>
          <p>Because of its stone-like constitution, concrete has a high tolerance to bear compression. Following this hint, we decided to adopt the principle of a reciprocal structure, where each element shares it’s weight with the following one until the solicitation comes back around into a full circle, making the structure stable. </p>
          <p>Either for conceptual rigor or for the economy of means, we designed our piece with the minimum amount of elements possible that could express static reciprocity in three dimensions. This gave rise to a triangular plan which assured resistance to lateral loads. There were only three points of contact between the casted plates in the whole structure, which were reinforced by metal pieces screwed from the top. Since the three cast plates were placed at an angle in relation to the floor, the dimension of the gap in between different plates created just enough space for people to access the interior area.</p>
          <p>Following the material dignity of bare necessity, or the phenomenological honesty of minimalists, we also exposed the play of texture in the opposing faces of the concrete plates. This effect came from the way in which these elements came into this world, with bubble plastic lining the bottom of the scaffolding and the damp atmosphere of Porto lining the rough finish of the poured concrete on top.</p>

          <p>God is brazilian. Or so goes the saying told by countless graffitied walls of country-size cities planted on a continent-size country. Whether deities are bound to national borders remains unknown to humankind, but regardless of irresolvable mysteries, this expression still preserves a particular truth: the debased essence of Brazil lies in its hybridity; if anywhere, the impossible synthesis of the divine is bound to dwell under the tropical sun.</p>
          <p>In the twentieth century, a colonized and colorized people suddenly found themselves in the position of exporters of entertainment commodities to the first world (such as Football stars and Bossa-Nova hits). This unprecedented inversion in the flux of cultural influence captivated the imagination of philosopher Vilém Flusser, who would attempt to describe the antropófagos that inhabit southern lands in the book “Brasilien oder die Suche nach dem neuen Menschen: Für eine Phänomenologie der Unterentwicklung.”</p>
          <p>In the realm of music, the apex of an aesthetics in motion has been captured by the hermetic expression (i.e coming from Hermeto Pascoal) “Quebrando Tudo,” or “Breaking Everything,” which describes the vigorous physical - and perhaps metaphysical - gestures of a soloing instrumentalist amid the cathartic climax of harmonious sound.</p>
          <p>In “Quebrando Tudo”, we experiment with the cosmogonic legacy of affluent cultures that became grounded among palm trees by unveiling some quintessential and obscure Brazilian music. Between an heterogeneously autogenous imaginary, we listen our way towards the universal language for the new men, the new women and beyond. Thematic playlists are curated each month by Antônio Frederico Lasalvia, sometimes joined by guests.</p>

          <p>Since the late 1990s, Dutch artist Jan van der Ploeg has made yearly pilgrimages to the subalpine confines between Italy and Slovenia. Over the years, and thanks to the Stazione di Topolò/Postaja Topolove festival, this painter left many traces of his presence over the village’s walls, in both indoor and outdoor spaces. On the occasion of his 65th birthday, Jan gifted Topolò with the restoration of two exterior works: a mural in the “dutch embassy” (Wall Painting No.551, previously No.62 and no.xx) and a painting over the public fountain (Wall Painting No.98). I followed him through this process and recorded his work with my video camera.</p>

          <p>During one of the morning painting sessions, Jan told me about second thoughts he had when he was asked to paint the fountain piece for the first time, back in the 2000s. “Was it just decoration?” As a reverberation of that, this short-film features what may be described as the less autonomous, less visible, but perhaps more gathering work.</p>

        <p>Following the engaging workshop on placeful websites guided by Benjamin Earl and Kirsten Spruit (hosted by Robida in early 2024), I decided to code my own website “by hand.” After a few months of intermittent html, ccs and java coding, and thanks to a little help from artificial intelligence, I am glad to finally see the thing online.</p>
        <p>I usually present myself as an undisciplined architect, and, being a bit of a flat ontologist, I have decided not to display my work according to any particular hierarchy: writing, radio, installations and video work equally interest me and are presented on the same level of practice. Therefore, the sequence in which projects appear is a product of chance, and each time the browser is updated a new order is curated at random.</p> 
        <p>I have also decided to claim the informality of Brazilian Portuguese speech when attributing a domain to this website. My surname is omitted from the url and, as it is usually the case when people address strangers in the tropics - and it is indifferent if one is speaking to a neighbor or to the president of the country - I simply declare my first (two) name(s).</p>

            <p>After holding the “Qui non si balla” workshop in Topolò in 2023, I had the pleasure of contributing with a short reflection for the “Academy of Margins: An Experiment on Learning With” publication by Robida.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Alongside the discourses centered around conviviality, care and marginality familiar to discussions in and regarding Topolò, Qui non si balla intended to bring forth these same themes, except, it proposed to do so in a way unmediated by reasoned discourse. Put differently, abstract concepts such as dependency and collaboration were to be embodied by participants throughout the proposed exercises in such a way that they would experience lived theory, or praxis.</p>
            <p>I have always been reluctant towards the expressivity of the body. Not that I find it inherently impossible, but rather that, for myself, any spontaneity in movement was dragged away from me the moment I became aware I was trying to express something. That's the drawback of self-awareness, which was described to us by Jean as we exchanged impressions at the end of the Qui non si balla workshop. According to her, the delightful thing about our morning practice was that the cadence of exercises allowed for movement to slowly and spontaneously develop, in such a way that she “got tricked into dancing.” By not putting a label on it, we were able to disinhibit experience and investigate usually avoided or stigmatized forms of relating to people, such as rolling on top of each other.</p> 
            <p>The universality of being a body is only matched by the inevitable specificity corporified by the nuances of anatomy: every human person exists singularly in the manner they occupy and move in space. And yet, this abundance of diversity, even though it is easily acknowledged, is seldomly put to use. What can we do from the consequences of being physical things? Such a question has been pursued by choreographer Steve Paxton in his early career and in the 1970’s led to the creation of the self-explanatory form called Contact Improvisation.</p>
            <p>When I was first exposed to Contact Improvisation, I became completely mesmerized by its spectacle of becoming. The hybrid sight of casually coordinated bodies was an open window to, as it seemed to me, bottomless insight. After a few years of practice and thought, its vastness has only increased. While trying to come to grips with it, I initially thought that what interested me was its powerful accomplishment of diluting agency over choreographic compositions between the engaged dancers. Impromptu resolutions that were mutually beneficial seemed like a potent model for anything, really. Lately, however, I have been trying to comprehend Contact Improvisation further than its acute disclosure of symmetry. If we think of Contact Improvisation under the light of assemblages, we can appreciate the consequent enlargement of the possibility space that an affiliation between heterogeneous bodies implies.</p>
            <p>Between the reflections that we left and leave after the Academy of Margins, I share a growing question: What impressive realities can be unveiled through the relationships we undergo - that are not merely derived from us, but outreach individual contributions because they spawn from unpredictable resonances that are formed by the encounter?</p>

        <p>From the Margins: An arborescent reading and listening room is an installation imagined by Robida Collective for the exhibition T3rza Terra: Michelangelo Pistoletto e Cittadellarte a Villa Manin in Codroipo (Udine).</p>
        <p>It takes up some of the practices and themes that the collective explores from Topolò/Topolove (Grimacco), the village in which the collective is based. Nature/culture, individual/collectivity, centre/margins, rootedness/rootlessness are some of the main dichotomies of our time that are presented in a reader, audio piece and installation in their ramifications and are made porous to be finally deconstructed through a collection of texts read by a multiplicity of voices.</p>
        <p>This reader offers multiple entry points into the rethinking of four binary oppositions: nature/culture, individual/collective, centre/margins, and rootedness/rootlessness and the borderlands between them. Each of these oppositions constitutes the (meta)physical tissue of Topolò/Topolove and all of the other places (re)configured throughout the process of Modernity. The purpose of this reader is not to dismantle borders between these terms but to make them porous. The border itself, if porous, unites, and creates affinities between the two sides. Therefore, this reader is an arborescent reader. More than articulating and hierarchising multiplicities we understand it functioning as a tree which simultaneously belongs to subterranean and heavenly realms. In this sense, to be arboreal mens to articulate opposing realities of light and dark, up and down. One and the other.</p> 
        <p>The question then emerges: How can we think of conceptual oppositions so as to let them intermingle, mix, or even hybridise? How might we imagine a world where borders remain, but are fluid, dynamic, and open to exchange? This reader provides insights and pathways toward exploring this porous borderful world.</p>

        <p>On the occasion of father and daughter showing their paintings together for the first time, I had the privilege of writing a critical text for the exhibition of Renzo Rucli and Elena Rucli, which took place at SMO [Slovensko Multimedialno Okno].</p>
        <br>
        <h1>EN</h1>
        <p>Other than the surnames and the fact that both have studied architecture, the Ruclis share an interest in the manuality of painting, a theme that has been marginalized in contemporary art practices ever since the ready-made displaced skill and the hand from artistic discourse. However, the way Renzo and Elena relate to the medium of paint and what they seek to achieve through it differs radically.</p>
        <p>Renzo Rucli is after absolute abstraction, in a dialectical opposition to the mimetic drive that characterized European painting since the renaissance. This is hinted by his predilection for the perfect square, a platonic abstraction which is absent from nature. The only representational element to be found in the canvas - a curious originary exception - is the form of the egg. However, even in this figurative residue, the author is more interested in its geometrical construction and historical allusion to Piero della Francesca than in its organic meaning.</p>
        <p>The self-imposed imperative of not contradicting the bidimensionality of painting finds expression even in Renzo Rucli’s choice of support. By moving away from the traditional framed canvas, he embraces a metallic surface which reduces the physicality of painting to a single plane. This artifice is the concrete instance where his life-long experience as an architect finds expression in his recent artistic practice.</p>
        <p>Other two tectonic aspects are to be found on the way Renzo Rucli builds his paintings: one comes from the almost project-like character of some works, which display the disintegration of geometrical shapes into seemingly chaotic patterns. However, this process follows strictly rational rules derived from operations based on the golden section, which transforms the artwork into a notation which communicates to the viewer how it was composed. The idea of construction also becomes explicit when attention is drawn to the joining of squares. This tension is often emphasized by a playful chromatic contrast and, in another instance of an exception which confirms the rule, by a freely drawn stroke right at the line where two squares meet.</p>
        <p>Elena Rucli has her visual research situated in the context where she dwells. Her interest does not lie in the study of intangible forms, but gravitates around the concrete things she can see with her own eyes. From the framing of close details to the evocation of atmospheric mountain horizons, her compositions exist somewhere in the middle between representation and abstraction.</p>
        <p>Within the investigation of her immediate environment, Elena Rucli avoids the unattainability of an objective account. By depicting the fleeting traces in forest paths, scattered compositions of light and shadow or the crooked arrangements of mineral strata and vegetal entwinements, her subjective point of view suspends the different time scales behind these actual formations and transfigures them into imagined shapes and colors.</p>
        <p>In other work, Elena Rucli displays painstakingly detailed illustrations in black and white. Lately, however, she has been drawn to the medium of painting because of the freedom it affords. From a technical point of view, her paintings avoid the precision of the straight line and mobilize the pleasure of free brush strokes over different layers of color. The only right corners to be found in the work lie on the square frames, but even these are not an unconditional commitment: she is also eager to experiment with the compositional and thematic implications of a round support. When it comes to pigment, her chromatic choice is intuitive and varies from ton on ton to high contrast compositions.</p>
        <p>Chance and order, nature and artifice, intuition and deliberation, naïveté and discipline are juxtaposed in contro-sguardo. Within this exchange, the spectator finds themselves in the middle of a multifaceted dialogue which results from the confrontation of the visual worlds familiar to Renzo Rucli and Elena Rucli.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>IT</h1>
        <p>Oltre al cognome e al fatto che entrambi siano laureati in architettura, i Rucli condividono l'interesse per la manualità del dipingere, tema che è ai margini delle pratiche artistiche contemporanee da quando il ready-made ha allontanato l'abilità tecnica e la mano dal discorso sull’arte. Tuttavia, il modo in cui Elena e Renzo si rapportano al mezzo pittorico e ciò che cercano di ottenere attraverso di esso differisce radicalmente.</p>
        <p>Renzo Rucli cerca l'astrazione assoluta, in opposizione dialettica alla spinta mimetica che ha caratterizzato la pittura europea fin dal Rinascimento. Lo suggerisce la sua predilezione per il quadrato perfetto, astrazione platonica assente in natura. L'unico elemento rappresentativo che compare sulla tela - curiosa eccezione originaria - è la forma dell'uovo; ma anche in questo residuo figurativo l’autore è più interessato alla sua costruzione geometrica e al suo riferimento storico a Piero della Francesca piuttosto che al suo significato organico.</p>
        <p>L'imperativo autoimposto di non contraddire la bidimensionalità della pittura trova espressione anche nella scelta del supporto. Scostandosi dalla tradizionale tela incorniciata, Renzo Rucli sceglie una superficie metallica che riduce la fisicità della pittura a un unico piano. Questo espediente è il modo concreto in cui l’esperienza di una vita da architetto si riflette nella sua recente pratica artistica.</p>
        <p>Altri due aspetti tettonici si ritrovano nel modo in cui Renzo Rucli costruisce i suoi dipinti: uno deriva dal carattere quasi progettuale di alcune opere, che mostrano la disintegrazione di forme geometriche in pattern solo apparentemente caotici. In realtà, questo processo segue regole strettamente razionali derivate dalla sezione aurea, che fanno dell'opera d'arte una notazione, comunicando all'osservatore come è stata composta. L'idea di costruzione diventa inoltre esplicita quando si richiama l'attenzione sull'incastro dei quadrati. Questa tensione è spesso enfatizzata da un giocoso contrasto cromatico e, in un altro caso di eccezione che conferma la regola, da un tratto disegnato liberamente proprio sulla linea di congiunzione di due quadrati.</p>
        <p>Elena Rucli situa la sua ricerca visiva nel contesto in cui vive. Il suo interesse non risiede nello studio di forme intangibili, ma gravita intorno alle cose concrete che può vedere con i suoi occhi. Dall'inquadratura di dettagli ravvicinati all'evocazione di orizzonti montuosi, i suoi lavori si collocano a metà strada tra astrazione e rappresentazione.</p>
        <p>Nell'indagine sull'ambiente circostante, Elena Rucli evita l'irraggiungibilità di un resoconto oggettivo. Raffigurando le tracce fugaci nei sentieri del bosco, le composizioni sparse di luci e ombre o le disposizioni irregolari di strati minerali e intrecci vegetali, il suo punto di vista soggettivo sospende le diverse scale temporali dietro queste formazioni reali e le trasfigura in forme e colori immaginari.</p>
        <p>Tra le altre opere di Elena si vedono illustrazioni minuziosamente dettagliate in bianco e nero. Ultimamente, però, è stata attratta dal mezzo pittorico per la libertà che offre. Da un punto di vista tecnico, i suoi dipinti scansano la precisione della linea dritta e mobilitano il piacere della pennellata libera su diversi strati di colore. Gli unici angoli retti che si trovano nell'opera sono le cornici quadrate, ma anch’esse non sono un impegno incondizionato: l'artista è altrettanto desiderosa di sperimentare le implicazioni compositive e tematiche di un supporto rotondo. Per quanto riguarda il pigmento, la sua scelta cromatica è intuitiva e varia dal tono su tono alle composizioni ad alto contrasto.</p>
        <p>Caso e ordine, natura e artificio, intuizione e razionalità, naïveté e disciplina sono accostati in contro-sguardo. All'interno di questo scambio, lo spettatore si trova al centro di un dialogo sfaccettato che emerge dal confronto dei mondi visivi familiari a Renzo Rucli ed Elena Rucli.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>SL</h1>
        <p>Poleg priimkov in dejstva, da sta oba študirala arhitekturo, Renza in Eleno Rucli druži zanimanje za ročnost slikanja, temo, ki je bila v sodobnih umetniških praksah marginalizirana, odkar je ready-made iz umetniškega diskurza izpodrinil veščino in človeško roko. Kljub temu se njuna načina uporabe medija barve in odgovora na vprašanje, kaj s tem medijem doseči, radikalno razlikujeta.</p>
        <p>Renzo Rucli išče absolutno abstrakcijo, ki jo najdemo v dialektičnem nasprotju mimetičnega zagona, ki je zaznamoval evropsko slikarstvo od renesanse. Na to namiguje njegova naklonjenost  popolnemu kvadratu, platonski abstrakciji, ki je v naravi ni. Edini element reprezentacije na njegovih platnih – nenavadna in izvorna izjema – je oblika jajca. Toda tudi pri tem figurativnem residuumu avtorja bolj kot organski pomen zanimata njegova geometrična konstrukcija in zgodovinska aluzija na Piera della Francesca.</p>
        <p>Samopredpisani imperativ nenasprotovanja dvodimenzionalnosti slike se v njegovem delu izraža celo v izbiri podlage. Namesto tradicionalnega, uokvirjenega platna se odloči za kovinsko podlago, ki fizičnost slike reducira na eno samo ploskev. Ta izbira je konkreten primer, kako njegove življenjske izkušnje arhitekta najdejo izraz v njegovi nedavno oblikovani umetniški praksi.</p>
        <p>Druga dva tektonska vidika je mogoče najti v načinu, kako Renzo Rucli gradi svoje slike. Prvi se kaže v skoraj projektnem značaju nekaterih del, ki prikazujejo razgradnjo geometrijskih oblik v navidezno kaotične vzorce. Vendar pa ta proces sledi strogo racionalnim pravilom, ki izhajajo iz operacij, narejenih na podlagi zlatega reza, ki umetnino spremeni v zapis, ki gledalcu razkriva način njenega  nastajanja. Ideja konstrukcije postane eksplicitna tudi takrat, ko pozornost pritegne sklepanje in stikanje kvadratov. Ta napetost je pogosto poudarjena z igrivim kromatičnim kontrastom in — še en primer izjeme, ki potrjuje pravilo — s prostoročno narisano potezo tik ob stičišču dveh kvadratov.</p>
        <p>Vizualne raziskave Elene Rucli so umeščene v kontekst, kjer biva. Njeno zanimanje ni usmerjeno v preučevanje neoprijemljivih oblik, ampak se giblje okrog konkretnih stvari, ki jih lahko vidi z lastnimi očmi. Njene kompozicije — od kadriranja detajlov do priklica atmosferskih gorskih obzorij — se nahajajo na presečišču med reprezentacijo in abstrakcijo.</p>
        <p>V raziskovanju svojega neposrednega okolja se Elena Rucli izogiba nedosegljivemu objektivnemu prikazu. Z upodabljanjem bežnih sledi v gozdnih poteh, razpršenih kompozicij svetlobe in sence ali ukrivljenih razporeditev mineralnih plasti in rastlinskih prepletov njen subjektivni pogled premosti različna časovna merila teh tvorb in jih pretvori v domišljijske oblike in barve.</p>
        <p>V drugih delih se Elena Rucli predstavlja s črno-belimi ilustracijam, ki skrbno in natančno poudarjajo podrobnosti. V zadnjem času pa jo slikarski medij vse bolj privlači zaradi svobode, ki jo ponuja. S tehničnega vidika se njene slike izogibajo natančnosti ravne linije in mobilizirajo užitek svobodne poteze čopiča preko različnih barvnih plasti. Edini pravi vogali v njenem delu so vogali kvadratnega okvirja slike, a niti tem ni brezpogojna zavezana: vneto eksperimentira namreč tudi s kompozicijskimi in tematskimi možnostmi okroglega platna. Ko gre za barvo, je njena izbira intuitivna in njene kompozicije lahko variirajo od tona do tona ali pa vsebujejo velike kontraste.</p>
        <p>Naključje in red, narava in umetelnost, intuicija in premišljenost, naivnost in disciplina so si postavljeni nasproti v kontra-pogled. Znotraj te izmenjave se gledalec znajde sredi večplastnega dialoga, ki izhaja iz soočenja dveh vizualnih svetov, ki sta tako zelo dobro poznana Renzu Rucliju in Eleni Rucli.</p>

        <p>This article presents a transdisciplinary investigation carried out between the spheres of art and industry through the work called Matriz 45. The exercise carried out by FAHR 021.3 arises from the opportunity to manipulate factory production using non-instrumental logics, which leads to the unveiling of possibilities untried in the techno-industrial complex. Based on the notion of the ‘end of art’ proposed by Arthur Danto, and in relation to the problem of ‘technical reproducibility’ raised by Walter Benjamin, the analysis of this contemporary experience allows us to deepen our understanding about a possible lineage for art today: an orientation that takes technique as a pretext to expose its own poietic character, that is, generative or creative possibilities beyond human determination.</p>

          <p>-Okay, and here we have a little bit of yellow.</p>
          <p>-And check it out the blue here. I would say that this is your blue. The one that you were speaking about. Just that one.</p>
          <p>-Exactly.</p>
          <p>-Yes, it's actually blue. Smells like sulfur.</p>
          <p>-I would say that these are the things we have.</p>
          <p>-So you say, at least if it turns out well we know that it’s a solid point.</p>
          <p>-In a way that you feel the pebbles, and remove the thick ones.</p>
          <p>-Like this we can see where these cracks go. If they grow bigger, if they remain the same…</p>
          <p>-There is a block here, in the middle of the rock.</p>
          <p>-All the rest for me was more or less 10 minutes.</p>
          <p>-Apart from roots - these are useless - but it’s a little sandy, a little dirty.</p>
          <p>-These are more or less two.</p>
          <p>-Yes, so still another one.</p>
          <p>-This sun dries.</p>
          <p>-Nice and dry.</p>
          <p>-Look, it's also true that maybe it rained some days ago… I mean, it's been only two days that it hasn't rained.</p>
          <p>-There is a little bit of mortar.</p>

          <p>The room is full of people. Movement surrounds me as bodies wander around the gallery. Whenever I can, I exchange gazes with them. Some visitors are puzzled and try to decipher my purpose in this setting. Though I lie bent over the floor, there is no chance that someone will accidentally stumble upon my edges. I rest as a lurking obstacle, signaled by a regular pattern made from bright paint and reflexive tape. The striking contrast works like a uniform and it looks like I just came out of a construction site, or an airport.</p>
          <p>Seven others like me share this space, and together we are eight. Each of us display visible hinges, which breaks our linearity down into modules according to simple divisions, like halves, fourths and so on. Since we are partitioned like a ruler which abruptly changes its scale, an optic mismatch happens when we are folded. The effect looks like a chess board out of sync, or a phased grid - it's a polyrhythmic thing. The irrational precision of our arrangement invokes a technical dimension to our art, as if we were the instruments that a mad topographer would use in order to make a surreal survey. But what is our purpose?</p>

          <p>Some photographs on the wall show us assembled in the landscape. We are framed while floating on ocean water, hanging off trees or balancing against volcanic cliffs. Although we were recently transported to this white-walled space, we still wear salt stains and exhibit scratches all over our squared surfaces. This brings an atmosphere of reality into the gallery - we are not untouchable models of an abstract idea, but actual artifacts indexed by the real world outside.</p>
          <p>Our articulations suggest that we can be unfolded in different ways in order to be deployed. For now we are neatly closed, all piled up upon ourselves. However, as we lure humans into manipulating us, another layer of sculpture comes through. Some are bold and lift sections of us above their heads, while trying to balance off limbs that erratically touch the ground. Others are swift in helping them structure the hybrid anatomy before the lurking collapse. It’s a sort of dance.</p>

          <p>Although we are lighter than we seem, our elusive leverages nevertheless present some danger. Junctures have their own will and a section may give way unannounced into a head or thingers if it is handled without attention. This creates a sense of devotion in the people who interact with us. For those witnessing it, the unscripted negotiation feels like a performance.</p>
          <p>Are we art? Though many hands have maneuvered us, our riddle cannot be grasped by a single resolution – for we have many. The degrees of freedom of our articulated construction offers possibilities beyond exhaustion, but we won't reveal all we can do immediately. Our most precious dispositions are situated and will only become manifest under the calling of a particular occasion. In our twisted world, our fate is to unfold unforeseen encounters.</p>

        <p>"Sentences on Site-Speculation: A few words for possible worlds" was originally published under "Site Speculation: a provisional manifesto in two parts" by FAHR 021.3</p>
        <br>
        <p>Site-specificity is usually understood as a series of relations established by an artistic intervention to whatever is unique to a site. These articulations can range from the phenomenological realm (extensive dimensions of a space, textures, light, scale, etc) to social aspects (pre-existent or made-up communities, vernacular traditions, matters of identity, etc). Over the recent past, site-specificity has been made into a safe ground for art practices because its substantial framing makes artistic choices seem inevitable. Yet, and by the same token, its reductive quality can produce an underlying aesthetic conditioning - not to say determinism - which effectively rules out particular possibilities in conceiving of art (namely, site-specificity excludes whatever is not derived from what exists).</p>
        <p>Whenever a concept or theory circulates with such familiarity that it can effortlessly be manipulated, those engaged in critical thinking are presented with the opportunity to reinvent it. In the contemporary artistic landscape, site-specific approaches seem to be close to such a threshold of exhaustion. Beyond the presented dichotomy of processual monotony and anticipated outcomes, attention to the real is to become something entirely different - or be abandoned altogether. </p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="project20_images/ELI_FFA_2716_ANTONIO FREDERICO LASALVIA.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo by Filipa Frois Almeida"><span class="alt-text"></span></div>
        <p>If site-specificity incorporates whatever an observer finds within a place, what kind of work can be done from things that do not (yet) exist, or that are not (currently) perceived? This question may lead to an heretical path for conceptual metamorphosis: a movement towards speculation.</p>
        <p>Site-speculation takes place as an exercise in fiction. This means exploring an opposite direction within site-specificity, where the artwork relates not to sited presences, but to sited absences. In this approach, the main question asked is not what is this context?, but rather, what other worlds were never born here? This is not an empty exercise propagated in vacuum, since the underlying reason behind this reformulation is an attempt to generate a breach into radical alterities.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="project20_images/ELI_FFA_2886_ANTONIO FREDERICO LASALVIA.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo by Filipa Frois Almeida"><span class="alt-text"></span></div>
        <p>Site-speculative elaborations are built upon contextualized cues. However, the investment in specificity realizes itself in an, as of yet, unrealized way. The artwork is not structured in order to convey any reference to actualized reality, but points toward the sphere of situated, unexpressed possibilities: this methodology recollects potential states from the plane of virtualities and superimposes them on the plane of actuality. In straightforward terms, this simply means to realize what could be, but is not.</p>
        <p>By definition, site-speculation is heterotopic. Work emerges from the suspension of ordinary reality through the instauration of a parallel framework. In the discontinuation of meaning, the familiar grasp of objects is rearranged as to create a new order of things. During this exercise, a possible world is brought into light, whose conditions of existence lurk latently in the present, but which never come to fruition because the inertia of collective worlding prevents it from doing so. Against a common backdrop, explicit alternatives are made visible by site-speculation via the manifestation of the unthought. And precisely here lies the disruptive potential of this approach: For the site-speculator, the disclosure of another world is not dependent on a radical schism, an epochal revolution or a disruptive invention; Otherness can be made present right here and now.</p>
        <p>If things were almost the same, would everything change?</p>

        <p>Uncommon Fruits is a project born from the collaboration between the extended Robida collective (Topolò, Benečija, IT) and Zavod Cepika (Kojsko, Goriška Brda, SI) that investigates two different landscapes through the lens of fruit trees – one, Goriška Brda, characterised by an almost-monoculture of vine and the other, the one surrounding Topolò, by abandonment – and the past, present and future relation humans have with it.</p>
        <p>Within the project Uncommon fruits, fruit trees and orchards are the lenses through which these landscapes are observed and reimagined. Uncommon Fruits collects memories and knowledges around fruit trees culture, explores gardening as a technique that potentiates the whole landscape, and promotes through various actions a more intimate relation between humans, trees, orchards and landscapes.</p> 
        <p>By re-imaging routines and rituals around fruit tree culture, we explore gestures of a returning practice that continues to be carried on. Following the seasons, the landscape, the bees, the hands, the basket, the kitchen table, the drying rack and the tart, we carry out an embodied research surrounding fruit tree culture and its cyclical movements. Crafting routes for uncommon fruits within daily routines and seasonal return.</p>

        <p>In 1851, gardner Joseph Paxton disturbed fully developed assumptions about architecture with his radical building system conceived for the Great Exhibition: the Crystal Palace demonstrated not only that the materiality of construction was bound to deviate into unprecedented paths thanks to the advent of new technologies – such as plate glass and cast iron – but also that modularity in construction, although familiar to Western tectonic culture, could mean fast assemblage and disassemblage. In 1972, choreographer Steve Paxton performed an analogous disorganization of expectations in the sphere of dance with the advent of an unscripted form: the development of Contact Improvisation testified to heterodoxical possibilities latent in the encounter between dancers, a direction that was not current among widely held notions about what constituted erudite dance because it went beyond the prescription of gestures and the predictability of outcomes. Both Paxtons have mobilized thought utterly and irreversibly in their fields for generations to come. This article proposes a transversal interpretation of these revolutionary ways of practice in order to rethink the stance of architects towards the built environment. In this sense, what connects the unrelated transformations brought forth by both Paxtons lies in the conception of form as a recursive structure. Could an approach based on feedback become a robust methodology for architecture in the 21st century? The last part of this article suggests a positive answer to this question, by briefly presenting three contemporary examples that deploy form as formlessness through the work of Lacaton & Vassal, Georges Descombes and Carla Juaçaba.</p>

        <p>"What does the machine want? Two cases of accidental translation in speculative cosmotechnics" presents two transdisciplinary works realized between art, education and industry in order to rethink the technical realm beyond ordinary human-oriented assumptions about instrumental use. The argument builds on Bruno Latour’s concept of translation in order to propose a contingency- based approach for using analog and electronic machines. The question behind this idea is simple: how can we productively deal with technological translations in order to cultivate a new imaginary based on collaboration instead of exploitation? A possible answer is rehearsed as we analyze two case studies led by the Portuguese studio FAHR 021.3. These works were carried in two distant geographies and established different theoretical relations to practice: one came from a conceptual challenge posed in an industrial context in Portugal and another was the result of a didactical inquiry in partnership with the University of Saint Joseph’s Robotic Lab, in Macau. In both cases, the surprising results came from deliberately following the faculties of machines beyond their calculated behaviors. Both experiences invest in a cosmotechnics purposefully open-ended and oriented toward the enhancement of unpredictability in digital and analog mediums. What does the machine want? If we entertain this question seriously and methodically, we may arrive at unforeseen answers.</p>

        <p>In Learning from Kozolci, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia speaks with architect Renzo Rucli about the historical unfolding and contemporary condition of the kozolec — a rural structure typical of Slovenian culture.
