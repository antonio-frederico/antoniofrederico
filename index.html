            <p>The first installation I made worked as an inquiry into questions of authorship, virtuality and embedded meaning (or the opposite of these things). This minimal intervention derives from signs found in the landscape. The work consists of 28 cryptic patterns painted on chosen trees. No two signs are the same and they all obey simple rules for their composition, which have been abstracted from the geometry of readymade trail markings. Instead of guiding people through a continuous line, these traces face the observer and indiscreetly point to the surrounding landscape. Thus, the work dislocates both the sense of direction and the expectation of meaning of whoever finds it.</p>

            <p><h3>IV (What)</h3></p>
            <p>Around Topolo, on the trails that cut through the forest, one can find markings that indicate the path. For them to establish visibility, contrast is achieved by the use of two different colors painted at eye height on trees and rocks. These noticeable strokes prevent hikers from getting lost. </p>		
            <p>In scrutinizing their shape, one can recognize that the existing simplicity relates both to their function and origin: these signs should be distinguishable from the surroundings and convenient to fabricate.</p>
            <p>The geometric solution consists of a rectangle that has, as height, twice the size of the brush used to paint it, and, as length, double the size of the first measure. The end result usually approximates the proportion of 1x2. This systematic approach provides for an angular rigor rarely produced by non-human action so the condition of sign is immediately recognizable.</p>
            <p>The encounter between isotropic geometry and an irregular, decaying world provides for a myriad of effects that obey different time scales: A tree might crack the paint, whereas a rock might let it be peeled away by weathering. This dynamic is not welcome in an unfamiliar context. The fading away of the color is a troublesome condition for visitors because it means the loss of efficacy for the purpose of path signaling.</p>

            <br>
            <p><h3>III (How)</h3></p>
            <p>With the same abstract rules, one can study the possible variations that geometry concedes for dividing a rectangle into two parts with the use of a single line (which starts and ends either at the edge’s midpoint or at one of the corners).</p>
            <p>The existence of such variations in the context of trail marking is unlikely, because, although these alternatives have an analogous syntax, they disobey the pragmatic principle of convenient technical reproduction. Hence, these constitute an implausible possible.</p>
            <p>The intervention consisted of painting, within a clear predetermined area, 28 trees and rocks with these cryptic anagrams. Whereas normal signs might indicate something, these equivocal marks dislocate the sense of direction. Because they are randomly situated in the landscape, these insignificant signs cannot point at anything in particular. They simply embody the condition of purposeless possibilities.</p>

            <p>The vulnerability of these fabricated traces before forest weathering will prove to be identical to the real ones. As such, color will be washed away with the passing of time.</p>
            <p>If these signs mark anything at all, it is their own transient condition.</p>

          <p>My contribution to the 9th issue of Robida Magazine was based on the execution and archival of an ephemeral installation. Within the time frame of daylight, I clandestinely swapped the land belonging to two bordering countries. In place of what was previously national soil, now there lies ground coming from the opposite side of the border. Be that as it may, the completion of the work made the intervention barely traceable. The only register of this event are some images caught by camera, together with a dirt diagram and a couple of sonnets written in the aftermath.</p>

          <p>The exchange was realized on an undisclosed site in the forest, in the authoritative limbo that characterizes the limit between two sovereign states. As a symbolic gesture executed over an immaterial historical division, the precise location of this work is ultimately abstract: it might have happened anywhere along an imaginary line, or an invisible threshold which can be traced thanks to concrete monoliths that were placed in this land when the border between Italy and Yugoslavia was drawn in the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>

          <p>Subterranean Transactions was inspired by neoconcrete “Poema Enterrado” (1959)  - or “Buried Poem” - by Ferreira Gullar, as alluded to in the ending verse of one of the sonnets published on the Suolo / Prtst / Soil issue of Robida Magazine.</p>

          <p>After over a year of work in Northern Portugal (in the territory around Arcos de Valdevez) with FAHR 021.3, Hugo and I published a text with some reflections regarding our methodology of involving art practices directly into urban/landscape planning starting from the project phase. The article critically overviews this experience based on the work of the first artist in residency, the photographer Joan Alvado.</p>
          <p>This article presents the partial results of an ongoing territorial practice/research project in the north of Portugal. The approach adopted is unprecedented in that cultural programming artistic practices are called upon at the design phase in order to provide input for territorial planning. Based on the need to get to know a territory as a result of an intervention requirement, a model of artist residencies is used as a tool to know a particular place. In this process, the work of the invited artist is conducted with the aim of revealing certain dimensions of everyday life. This approach, however, encounters methodological, institutional and artistic challenges. By reflecting on the first case-study of this experimental model (the photographic project carried out by Joan Alvado), we aim to open up a space for the discussion and perpetuation of similar strategies for integrating art and the built landscape.</p>
          <p>The article is divided into five parts. Starting with the contemporary context from which discursive concerns about the incorporation of cultural alterities into creative processes arise, it moves on to a brief contextualization and critique of artistic approaches with an anthropological bias. Next, the landscape relating to the context of the work in question is presented and the case study carried out in Arcos de Valdevez is described. Finally, we conclude by raising some weaknesses and opportunities for future applications of this integration.</p>

          <p>The day after I moved to Topolò, the first episode of “When Thinking is Doing: a radio show for handy theory” was broadcast at Radio Robida. This project was originally supposed to focus on craft and its peripheral manifestations, but it quickly became more encompassing in scope as it started to deal with different perspectives regarding aesthetics, philosophy of technology and new materialism(s).</p>
          <p>The show’s format oscillates between formal theoretical framings and informal conversations with guests, who have hands-on experience in some specific practice (chefs, woodworkers, programmers, masons, painters, choreographers, etc.)</p>

          <p>Things disclose worlds. Subjacent to any symbolic sphere, the ways we approach our earthly dealings are mediated by hard artifacts. What can we learn through their making? In When Thinking is Doing, we aim not so much to think about craft, but rather by means of it.</p>

          <h2>Season 2 / 2024 (ongoing)</h2>
          <p>The world is a whole. From a materialist perspective, between dense solids and rarefied plasmas, the discontinuities of tangible matter are always a question of scale and never actual interruptions on the fabric of reality. And yet, not only do we perceive, but we also enforce borders.</p>
          <p>A border separates. It stipulates a distinction between elements. It creates opposites out of what is. What are the consequences of this segmenting action for the ways in which we conceptualize the world? Is there something advantageous to approach intellectual impasses by establishing simple antinomies among things? Could it be dangerous to polarize? How and why?</p>
          <p>In the second season of When Thinking is Doing, we will indulge in bordering thought. In each episode, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia conceptualizes craft and its neighboring areas by creating clear categories around them - often, only to find out that these limits are porous and trespassers negotiate their confines just as we are not looking. Through the perspectives of different guests engaged with hand and head work, we will try to better understand not only the complexities of making, but of the making of the world.</p>

          <p>Craft as a category of practice historically emerged from the contrast between artisanal modes of production and modern industry. How can we deterritorialize craft and its congenital opposition to mechanized labour? In the eight episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by guests Antonio Sotzu and Jean Ni in order to discuss stratified ideas about relations of labour. In our conversation, matters of pleasure, knowledge and meaning in old-fashioned techniques are discussed with regard to their territorial approach to stone artifact making/maintenance. We also discuss their life-project Foghiles, based in Semèstene, Sardinia, where borders between life and art are dissolved.</p>

          <p>The term craft is usually reserved to qualify a way of making material things. How would this notion stand when transposed to the immaterial realm? In the ninth episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by Kirsten Spruit and Benjamin Earl in order to think through the border between the digital and the analog. As we look for procedures analogous to craft within digital tools, we consider themes like the poetic web, handmade websites, Ben and Kirsten’s “code of conduct of code”, as well as their growing interest in rituals of maintenance.</p>

          <p>The ways of aesthetically engaging with matter have been deployed with varying importance according to each particular culture. Could it be that the different social standings that different art practices historically reached in the West is related to a phenomenology of sensory experience? In the tenth episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by Suzanne Bernhardt and Phillip Kolman in order to think about the making of food. While we go outside to forage while-cherry blossoms Phillip and Suzanne speak about how they see their cooking practice with regard to autochthonous food cultures, the role of the ephemerality in taste and the ecological consequences of alimentary production.</p>

          <p>Between matter’s character and maker’s character, what might craft mean when one attends to the way in which raw materials express their forms? In the eleventh episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by the architect and cabinetmaker Diogo Amaro in order to think about the border between form and matter. The conversation touches on themes like anticipation and spontaneity in work, the role of prototyping, the contrast between serial and singular production and the consequences of an empirical approach to design.</p>

          <p>When people refer to technology in a colloquial sense, they usually mean high-tech stuff like automobiles, skyscrapers or telecommunication systems, which depend on the integration of many different parts. The lure of technological complexity makes it easy to overlook the embedded cleverness of low-tech artifacts, which couple material simplicity with technical effectiveness. From times immemorial, craft cultures from all around the globe found many fine solutions for locally sourced materials. These were informed by the constituent capacities of working matters (such as the friction of fibers, the resistance of stone, the pliability of clay and so on).</p>
          <div class="image-container"><img src="project6_images/CANAVIAL_ANTONIO FREDERICO LASALVIA_AAA013.jpg" alt="Photo by Thomas Symosz"><span class="alt-text"></span></div>
          <p>In 2022 I found myself among another dozen young designers under the scorching sun of Évora’s summer in order to make sense of the overlap between these two worlds (if one insists on making such a rigid distinction): high-tech and low-tech. The premise of the workshop was “artisanship meets digital fabrication,” and we were engaged in designing and building a shading device made from locally harvested cane.</p>
          <p>After some speculative prototyping, we finally arrived at the conclusion that the best way to structure this material had already been invented long before we put our minds to it. It was actually all around us, we just had to have eyes to see it. It is hard to tell precisely where woven cane fences were first made, but nowadays this art can easily be spotted in any warm-weather country, usually employed by small production farmers to enclose their crops and land.</p>
          <p>Cane weaving is a dirt-cheap technique, but working this material is not an easy job. The fibers of this bamboo-like plant are unforgiving (because they easily break when twisted in the wrong direction) and are quite hard on the laboring hands (since the splitting of cane creates very fine splinters). Moreover, the result of this craft is not particularly durable when in direct contact with ground moisture, a condition which is usually addressed in the case of farmers not by avoiding it, but by simply weaving a new fence every few years. I guess all of these things created some cultural stigma around this material and made it a no-go for both designers and architects.</p>
          <div class="image-container"><img src="project6_images/CANAVIAL_ANTONIO FREDERICO LASALVIA_Canavial.gif" alt="Video by Fatima Durkee ⒸPassaAoFuturo"><span class="alt-text"></span></div>
          <p>Back to our workshop, and to our attempt to reclaim cane as building matter, it was only once we realized that we did not have to invent anything new that the whole process of making finally flowed smoothly. In order to address the moisture problem, we designed the structure in such a way that it could be easily disassembled during the rainy season. And, as a way to achieve enough height in order to create shadow with this weaving technique (cane fences are usually no higher than a meter or so), we simply inverted the orientation of the weave in relation to the ground. By aligning the longer cane pieces perpendicularly to the floor, we mimicked the normal solicitations of this material and took advantage of its natural resistance to the efforts generated by wind and gravity.</p>
          <p>The result worked wonders. Although the structure was located on an unshaded field, the temperature inside was several degrees cooler than the outside. Moreover, the openness between the weaved panels allowed the interior of the structure to be penetrated by a very welcome summer breeze.</p>
          <p>As an allusion to the fact that we - almost - managed to build the whole thing with just one material (some wicker and cotton fibers were also used in order to tie the poles and the panels), we decided to embrace the organic character of this grown material and leave the cane tops untrimmed.</p>

          <p>Marc-Antonie Laugier fantasized about archaic man and double shed roofs when he described the seminal origins of architecture with the so-called “primitive hut”. Richard Serra, a few centuries later, arrived at a steeper conclusion which was formally not too distant from Laugier’s abstraction, despite this sculptor's perpetual rebellion against architecture. Amid these two unrelated episodes, the average expression between the sister disciplines of three dimensional space may lie not in two, nor in four, but in three intersecting planes.</p>

          <p>During my Master’s degree in Universidade do Porto, I partook in a course on structural conception and experimentation. The semester’s exercise started with a constraint, something that I always consider a welcome element in creative contexts. We had at our disposal the volume of one cubic meter of concrete and were allowed to shape it as we pleased as long as the result expressed the potential of this material to behave as structure. </p>
          <p>Because of its stone-like constitution, concrete has a high tolerance to bear compression. Following this hint, we decided to adopt the principle of a reciprocal structure, where each element shares it’s weight with the following one until the solicitation comes back around into a full circle, making the structure stable. </p>
          <p>Either for conceptual rigor or for the economy of means, we designed our piece with the minimum amount of elements possible that could express static reciprocity in three dimensions. This gave rise to a triangular plan which assured resistance to lateral loads. There were only three points of contact between the casted plates in the whole structure, which were reinforced by metal pieces screwed from the top. Since the three cast plates were placed at an angle in relation to the floor, the dimension of the gap in between different plates created just enough space for people to access the interior area.</p>
          <p>Following the material dignity of bare necessity, or the phenomenological honesty of minimalists, we also exposed the play of texture in the opposing faces of the concrete plates. This effect came from the way in which these elements came into this world, with bubble plastic lining the bottom of the scaffolding and the damp atmosphere of Porto lining the rough finish of the poured concrete on top.</p>

          <p>God is brazilian. Or so goes the saying told by countless graffitied walls of country-size cities planted on a continent-size country. Whether deities are bound to national borders remains unknown to humankind, but regardless of irresolvable mysteries, this expression still preserves a particular truth: the debased essence of Brazil lies in its hybridity; if anywhere, the impossible synthesis of the divine is bound to dwell under the tropical sun.</p>
          <p>In the twentieth century, a colonized and colorized people suddenly found themselves in the position of exporters of entertainment commodities to the first world (such as Football stars and Bossa-Nova hits). This unprecedented inversion in the flux of cultural influence captivated the imagination of philosopher Vilém Flusser, who would attempt to describe the antropófagos that inhabit southern lands in the book “Brasilien oder die Suche nach dem neuen Menschen: Für eine Phänomenologie der Unterentwicklung.”</p>
          <p>In the realm of music, the apex of an aesthetics in motion has been captured by the hermetic expression (i.e coming from Hermeto Pascoal) “Quebrando Tudo,” or “Breaking Everything,” which describes the vigorous physical - and perhaps metaphysical - gestures of a soloing instrumentalist amid the cathartic climax of harmonious sound.</p>
          <p>In “Quebrando Tudo”, we experiment with the cosmogonic legacy of affluent cultures that became grounded among palm trees by unveiling some quintessential and obscure Brazilian music. Between an heterogeneously autogenous imaginary, we listen our way towards the universal language for the new men, the new women and beyond. Thematic playlists are curated each month by Antônio Frederico Lasalvia, sometimes joined by guests.</p>

          <p>Since the late 1990s, Dutch artist Jan Van der Pleug has made yearly pilgrimages to the subalpine confines between Italy and Slovenia. Over the years, and thanks to the Stazione di Topolò/Postaja Topolove festival, this painter left many traces of his presence over the village’s walls, in both indoor and outdoor spaces. On the occasion of his 65th birthday, Jan gifted Topolò with the restoration of two exterior works: a mural in the “dutch embassy” (Wall Painting No.551, previously No.62 and no.xx) and a painting over the public fountain (Wall Painting No.98). I followed him through this process and recorded his work with my video camera.</p>

          <p>During one of the morning painting sessions, Jan told me about second thoughts he had when he was asked to paint the fountain piece for the first time, back in the 2000s. “Was it just decoration?” As a reverberation of that, this short-film features what may be described as the less autonomous, less visible, but perhaps more gathering work.</p>

          <br> When the flush of a newborn sun fell first on Eden's green and gold,  
          <br>Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched with a stick in the mold;   
          <br>And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart,   
          <br>Till the Devil whispered behind the leaves: "It's pretty, but is it Art?"

        <p>Untitled, Unnumbered (2024) features the painter Jan Van der Pleug at work, through the gradual appearance of shadows, brushes, hands, voices, faces and full bodies, which help build a sense of community around his work.</p>

        <p>Following the engaging workshop on placeful websites guided by Benjamin Earl and Kirsten Spruit (hosted by Robida in early 2024), I decided to code my own website “by hand.” After a few months of intermittent html, ccs and java coding, and thanks to a little help from artificial intelligence, I am glad to finally see the thing online.</p>
        <p>I usually present myself as an undisciplined architect, and, being a bit of a flat ontologist, I have decided not to display my work according to any particular hierarchy: writing, radio, installations and video work equally interest me and are presented on the same level of practice. Therefore, the sequence in which projects appear is a product of chance, and each time the browser is updated a new order is curated at random.</p> 
        <p>I have also decided to claim the informality of Brazilian Portuguese speech when attributing a domain to this website. My surname is omitted from the url and, as it is usually the case when people address strangers in the tropics - and it is indifferent if one is speaking to a neighbor or to the president of the country - I simply declare my first (two) name(s).</p>
