      <p>Following the engaging workshop on placeful websites guided by Benjamin Earl and Kirsten Spruit (hosted by Robida in early 2024), I decided to code my own website “by hand.” After a few months of intermittent html, ccs and java coding, and thanks to a little help from artificial intelligence, I am glad to finally see the thing online.</p>
      <p>I usually present myself as an undisciplined architect, and, being a bit of a flat ontologist, I have decided not to display my work according to any particular hierarchy: writing, radio, installations and video work equally interest me and are presented on the same level of practice. Therefore, the sequence in which projects appear is a product of chance, and each time the browser is updated a new order is curated at random.</p> 
      <p>I have also decided to claim the informality of Brazilian Portuguese speech when attributing a domain to this website. My surname is omitted from the url and, as it is usually the case in the tropics when people address strangers - and it is indifferent if one is speaking to a neighbor or to the president of the country - I simply declare my first (two) name(s).</p>
