        <p>After over a year of work in Northern Portugal (in the territory around Arcos de Valdevez) with FAHR 021.3, Hugo and I published a text with some reflections regarding our methodology of involving art practices directly into urban/landscape planning from the project phase. The article critically overviews this experience based on the work of the first artist in residency, the photographer Joan Alvado.</p>
        <p>This article presents the partial results of an ongoing territorial practice/research project in the north of Portugal. The approach adopted is unprecedented in that artistic programming and practices are called upon at the time of the project to provide input for territorial planning. Based on the need to get to know a territory as a result of an intervention requirement, a model of artist residencies is used as a tool to explore the place. In this process, the work of the invited artist is conducted with the aim of revealing certain veiled dimensions of everyday life. This approach, however, encounters methodological, institutional and artistic challenges. By reflecting on the first case of applying this model (the essay carried out by photographer Joan Alvado), we aim to open up a space for the discussion and perpetuation of similar strategies for integrating art and the built landscape. The article is divided into five parts. Starting with the contemporary context from which discursive concerns about the incorporation of cultural alterities into creative processes arise, it moves on to a brief contextualization and critique of artistic approaches with an anthropological bias. Next, the landscape relating to the context of the work in question is presented and the case study carried out in Arcos de Valdevez is described. Finally, we conclude by raising some weaknesses and opportunities for future applications of this integration.</p>
