      <p>Log is a platform conceived for the Uncommon Fruits project in order to mediate the relationship between people and the landscape. This relational piece is integrated in the topography in such a way that it suits different functions according to where it is approached from: it can be a table, a bench, a bed and more. </p>

      <p>All of the materials used during construction were locally sourced, including the walnut and chestnut wood, which was collected from dead standing trees nearby. The pebbles for the foundation were collected from the river, and the stones from collapsed dry stone walls.</p>

      <br>
      <p>The joints are connected by friction in an interlocked construction, typical of Japanese carpentry. No screws, glue or nails were used. The bases of the pillars were charred to increase moisture resistance and the whole structure was treated with a mixture of beeswax and linseed oil.</p>

      <p>The Uncomon Woods residency, which lead to the contruction of Log, was documented into a book during the Uncommon Folds residency, by Heike Reneé de Wit, and is currently being revised for publication. Both Uncommon Fruits and Uncommon Folds were funded by the Culture Moves Europe mobility program.</p>
