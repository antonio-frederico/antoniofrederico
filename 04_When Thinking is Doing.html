        <p>The day after moving to Topolò I broadcast the first episode of “When Thinking is Doing: a radio show for handy theory”. Originally, this project was supposed to focus on craft and it’s peripheral manifestations, but it quickly became more encompassing in scope as it started to deal with different perspectives regarding technique. The show’s format fluctuates between theoretical framings and conversations with guests, who have hands-on experience in some specific area (chefs, woodworkers, programmers, masons, painters, etc.)</p>

        <h2>Season 1 / 2023</h2>
        <p>Things disclose worlds. Subjacent to any symbolic sphere, the ways we approach our earthly dealings are mediated by hard artifacts. What can we learn through their making? In When Thinking is Doing, we aim not so much to think about craft, but rather by means of it.</p>

        <h2>Season 2 / 2024 (ongoing)</h2>
        <p>The world is a whole. From a materialist perspective, between dense solids and rarefied plasmas, the discontinuities of tangible matter are always a question of scale and never actual interruptions on the fabric of reality. And yet, not only do we perceive, but we also enforce borders.</p>
        <p>A border separates. It stipulates a distinction between elements. It creates opposites out of what is. What are the consequences of this segmenting action for the ways in which we conceptualize the world? Is there something advantageous to approach intellectual impasses by establishing simple antinomies among things? Could it be dangerous to polarize? How and why?</p>
        <p>In the second season of When Thinking is Doing, we will indulge in bordering thought. In each episode, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia conceptualizes craft and its neighboring areas by creating clear categories around them - often, only to find out that these limits are porous and trespassers negotiate their confines just as we are not looking. Through the perspectives of different guests engaged with hand and head work, we will try to better understand not only the complexities of making, but of the making of the world.</p>

        <p>The eighth episode of WTID comes in hybrid form. The first part (1:38) of the show is a theoretical introduction where we problematize the very notion of craft following art historian Glenn Adamson’s critique of craft’s origin in the wake of the industrial revolution. How can we deterritorialize craft and its congenital opposition to mechanized labour? In the second part of the show (13:00), some of the questions raised in the introduction are tackled from the perspective of guests Antonio Sotzu and Jean Ni. In our conversation, matters of pleasure, knowledge and meaning in old-fashioned techniques are discussed in relation to their territorial approach to stone artifacts making/maintenance. We also discuss their life-project Foghiles, based in Semèstene, Sardinia, where borders between life and art are dissolved.</p>

        <p>The term craft is usually reserved to qualify a way of making material things. How would this notion stand when transposed to the immaterial realm? In the ninth episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by Kirsten Spruit and Benjamin Earl in order to think through the border between the digital and the analog. As we look for procedures analogous to craft within digital tools, we consider themes like the poetic web, handmade websites, Ben and Kirsten’s “code of conduct of code”, as well as their growing interest in rituals of maintenance.</p>

        <p>In the tenth episode of When Thinking is Doing, Antônio Frederico Lasalvia is joined by Suzanne Bernhardt and Phillip Kolman in order to think about the making of food. In the introduction, the culinary arts are considered in relation to other forms of aesthetically engaging with matter, such as painting or sculpture. Could it be that the different social standings that these practices historically reached is related to a phenomenology of sensory experience? In the second part of the show, we go outside to pick wild-cherry flowers. While foraging in the forest, Phillip and Suzanne speak about how they see their cooking practice with regard to autochthonous food cultures, the role of the ephemerality in taste and the ecological consequences of alimentary production.</p>

      <p>In 2024, the When Thinking is Doing became part of The Other Radio/Radio Drugega, which is financed by Javni zavod GO! 2025 - Evropska prestolnica kulture, Nova Gorica and is part of the official program of the European Capital of culture.</p>
